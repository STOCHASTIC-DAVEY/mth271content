    "which we can computationally approach. This is an instance of the *power method,*  a topic well studied in numerical analysis. This method only needs to *apply* the matrix $P^t$ repeatedly (and has no need for other operations found in general eigensolvers that carry more memory overhead). This exercise shows you the practical problems with using a general eigensolver as the graph size increases and asks you to implement the power method to be able to solve on large graphs."
