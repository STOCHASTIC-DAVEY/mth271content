The data  is also packaged together with MatlabÂ® and they maintain an  [online documentation page on it](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/cancer-detection.html).  High-dimensional biological and genetic datasets are often highly correlated, i.e.,  patients can be expected to have  significant overlap in genes and biomarkers. Therefore such datasets will generally benefit from PCA and dimensional reduction. In this exercise,  you will work with a realistic dataset which exemplifies such a dimensional reduction."
