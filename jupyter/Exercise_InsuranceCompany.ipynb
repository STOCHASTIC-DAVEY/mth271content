However, the  insurance company is engaged in very risky business: each day, with probability $q=0.46$, the company may receive a claim, which will require it to pay \\\\$200 from its reserve the day it receives the claim. \n",

When $G$ has no chips to play, $G$ is ruined; when the insurance company's reserve drops to \\\\$0, it is ruined.)\n",
