    "At [SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Project)](https://snap.stanford.edu/index.html), you will find a large graph data set (with over 5 million edges) called the  *Google Web Graph*. (This graph was released by google for a programming competition.) Download this graph, examine the file, and guess the format. You will need to load this data into your computer's memory to solve this exercise. Think carefully about what tools you would use so as not to run  out of memory. \n",
