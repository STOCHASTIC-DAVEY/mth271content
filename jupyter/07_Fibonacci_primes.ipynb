    "Verification refers to the process of cross checking that a program behaves as expected in a few chosen cases. It is the developer's responsibility to ensure that a code is correct. Part of this responsibility involves  designing and adding **test functions** that verify that the code produces the correct output in a few cases where correct output is known. Complex codebases with multiple files often have a suite of test functions. After a development team member changes one file, if the test suite does not pass all tests, it is a sign that the change has broken the code functionality due to some unanticipated  repercussions of the change in other parts of the code."

We could design checks, say by verifying that our prime number routine is correct for the first few primes, plus a similar check for Fibonacci numbers. Or, we could look up the known Fibonacci prime numbers and see if we have got the first few correctly. Design of such tests is the process of verification. While there no standard method for it, one  often used principle is to *code with all cases in mind and test using known cases.*"
