    "[Mauna Loa Observatory](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/mlo/) is located over 3000 meters above the sea level, on the Big Island of Hawaii. [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, runs this facility, and has been collecting data on the composition of our atmosphere for years.  The rise of CO$_2$ in our atmosphere is one of the drivers of climate change as CO$_2$ is a heat-trapping gas. NOAA measures CO$_2$ levels at the observatory and had made available its data for all.\n",
