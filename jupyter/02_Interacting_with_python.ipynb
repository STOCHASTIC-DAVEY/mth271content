    "[Python](http://www.python.org/) is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language with a clean and expressive syntax. The following  features make for easy code development and debugging in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Python code is interpreted:* There is no need to compile the code. Your code is read by a  python interpreter and made into executable instructions for your computer in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Python is dynamically typed:* There is no  need to declare the type of a variable or the type of an input to a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Python has automatic garbage collection or memory management:* There is no need to explicitly allocate memory for variables before you use them or deallocate them after use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, keep in mind that these features also make pure python code slower (than, say C) in repetitious loops because of repeated checking for the type of objects. Therefore many python modules (such as `numpy`, which we shall see in detail soon), have C or other compiled code, which is then wrapped in python to take advantage of python's usability without losing speed. \n",

    "1. Use a python shell\n",
    "2. Use an iPython shell\n",
    "3. Put code in a python file ending in `.py`\n",
