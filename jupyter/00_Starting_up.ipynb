    "Type `python` into a terminal. If you have python, the terminal will become an interactive python shell where the python version is printed.  If the version starts with `3.` you have Python 3. If your version number starts with `2.` then your `python` command calls Python 2. *We will not use Python 2 in this course.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If `python` on your command line gives you an error message or runs Python 2, please check to see what you get when you type `python3` into the terminal. In some systems, Python 3 is accessed using the `python3` command.   If you don't have Python 3, then you will need to install it either from \n",
