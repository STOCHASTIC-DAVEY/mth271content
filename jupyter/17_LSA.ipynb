    "In the study of information retrieval systems, a fundamental question is how to extract documents from a large collection in response to a user query. A simplistic way is to pick out all documents which contain the query words. Is there a more \"intelligent\" way?\n",
    "Documents usually have interrelated *concepts* and if a query could be matched to a  concept, perhaps the results extracted would look more intelligent. Documents are written in natural language, using copious amounts of *words*, yet the number of topics that people write about are usually much smaller than the number of words they use.\n",

    "Returning to the question of information retrieval posed at the beginning of the lecture, let's consider how to handle queries. *Free text query*, is a form of query popular on internet searches, where query terms are typed in without any connecting operators.  Query terms can be any collection of words extracted from the corpus. A query vector can be made by taking the mean of these query word vectors and normalizing it to a unit vector. (Again this is not  a foolproof strategy,  but it is a simple prescription that often works well.) The cosine separation between the query vector and each document vector is then computed. The most relevant documents are considered to be the ones that make the smallest angle with the query vector, so they are returned first in the output list. Here is a quick implementation  suitable for small datatsets."

    "Let me conclude this introduction to the subject of text analysis and information retrieval by noting that the concept of mapping words to vectors is finding increasingly significant uses, such as in automatic translation. I have tried to present ideas in  minimal examples, but you should be aware that there are many extensions in the literature. Some extensions are easy to see as emerging from computational experience. An example is a generalization that we will see in the exercises that modifies the term-document matrix to account for the number of times a term occurs in a document. The resulting matrix will have frequency-weighted entries, not just 0 and 1 as above. This is built into  scikit-learn's text analysis facilities,  which we shall use in the exercise."
