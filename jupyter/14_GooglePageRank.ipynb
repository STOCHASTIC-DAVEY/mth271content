    "In the history of the internet, a collection of papers proposing *PageRank* has been  influential, in particular,  a  <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-7552(98)00110-X\">1998 paper</a> by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, two graduate students, now better known as Google co-founders. They proposed an objective metric to order the results of a user's internet search. For those who don't   remember, there was indeed a time when \"junk results often wash[ed] out any results that a user is interested in,\" to quote the paper.  Of course, search engines now operate in a competitive business world, and the algorithms that Google and other companies use to rank their search results currently are not public knowledge. But the concept of PageRank is now routinely applied  beyond Google, not just to the internet, but to general data on graphs and networks.  It serves as an automatic tool to rank the relative importance of parts of any internet-like giant network. \n",

    "We shall view the web (internet) as a directed graph. Each internet location (a webpage) is a vertex of the graph. A hyperlink from one webpage to another is a directed edge of the graph. From this viewpoint, the central idea of Brin & Page was to exploit  the \"link structure of the web to calculate a quality ranking for each web page.\"\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce PageRank, we shall build on our previous discussion of Markov chains (from [Gambler's Ruin](13_GamblersRuin.ipynb)), which was entirely from the *statistical* or probabilistic perspective.  Below, we will connect to theorems of Perron and Frobenius, which are results that one might usually learn in a *mathematics* program. Of course, all of this helps us understand the effectiveness of PageRank, a topic that has entered the *computer science* curricula in recent decades.  Taken together, we then have an example of propitious convergence of ideas from the  distinct fields of *computer science, mathematics, and statistics.* "

Since $V_j$ can be arrived at from $V_k$ with probability $p_{kj}$, and since the prior state  was  $V_k$ with probability  $x_k$, we conclude that the answer should be the sum of $p_{kj} \\times x_k$ over all the prior states $V_k$.

In the statistics literature, a Markov chain is  called an *ergodic Markov chain* if it is possible to arrive at any state from any other state in one or more steps. In other words, a Markov chain is ergodic if its digraph has paths made of directed edges from any vertex to any other vertex. This concept is therefore  equivalent to its transition matrix being *irreducible*, and indeed, several texts use the adjective irreducible instead of ergodic when studying such Markov chains.  In computer science and in graph theory, a directed graph whose vertices can be connected by a path of directed edges is called *strongly connected,* yet another name for the same concept.  We have seen several such instances  of distinct names for essentially the same concept in this and the previous activity. While  it may be a nuisance that the names are not standardized, it's not  surprising for a concept that emerged as important in different disciplines to get distinct names attached to it;  it may even speak to the universality of the concept.
