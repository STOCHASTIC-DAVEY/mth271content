# Lectures on Mathematical Computing With Data Using Python

This is a git repository containing the codes and notebooks for **Lectures on Mathematical Computing With Python.** They were prepared for the MTH271 
course offered at Portland State University
during Spring 2020 quarter and are stored here in the form of Jupyter Notebooks 
(without output cells). An html (static) version of these materials, 
including executed jupyter notebooks 
with populated output cells, can also 
[be read elsewhere](http://web.pdx.edu/~gjay/teaching/mth271_2020/html/_CONTENTS.html). After the term, the materials were archived by Portland State University Library as an [Open Educational Resource](https://doi.org/10.15760/pdxopen-28).
