# Course Materials for MTH 271

This is a git repository containing  materials for MTH271, **Mathematical
Computing With Data,** a course offered at Portland State University
during Spring 2020 quarter. Jupyter notebooks are saved in non-executed state
without saving outputs. Run the notebooks by calling jupyter notebook from the
folder enclosing the git repository `mth271content` (not within `mth271content`) 
in order for the relative links to work. 

An html (static) version of these materials, including executed jupyter notebooks 
with populated output cells, can 
[be read elsewhere](http://web.pdx.edu/~gjay/teaching/mth271_2020/html/_CONTENTS.html).
